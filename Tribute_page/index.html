                <h3 class="text-muted">a. Pyrrhus et Cineas</h3>
                <p class="lead"> For most of her life, Beauvoir was concerned with the ethical responsibility that the individual
                    has to him or herself, other individuals and to oppressed groups. Her early work,
                    <em> Pyrrhus et Cinéas(1944)</em>  approaches the question of ethical responsibility
                    from an existentialist framework long before Sartre was to attempt the same endeavor.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-muted">b. The Ethics of Ambiguity</h3>
                <p class="lead text-justify">
                    In many ways, <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947)</em> continues themes first developed in Pyrrhus et Cinéas.
                    Beauvoir continues to believe in the contingency of existence in that there is no necessity that we exist and
                    thus there is no predetermined human essence or standard of value. Of particular importance, Beauvoir expounds
                    upon the idea that human freedom requires the freedom of others for it to be actualized. Although Beauvoir was
                    never fully satisfied with <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>, it remains a testament to her long-standing concern with
                    freedom, oppression, and responsibility, as well as to the depth of her philosophical understanding of the
                    history of philosophy and of her own unique contributions to it.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Feminism</h2>
                <h3 class="text-muted">The Second Sex</h3>
                <p class="lead text-justify"> Most philosophers agree that Beauvoir's greatest contribution to philosophy is her revolutionary magnum opus,
                    <em>The Second Sex</em>. Published in two volumes in 1949 (condensed into one text divided into two "books" in English),
                    this work immediately found both an eager audience and harsh critics. <em>The Second Sex</em> was so controversial
                    that the Vatican put it (along with her novel, The Mandarins) on the Index of prohibited books.
                    At the time <em>The Second Sex</em> was written, very little serious philosophy on women from a feminist perspective had been done.
                    With the exception of a handful of books, systematic treatments of the oppression of women both historically and
                    in the modern age were almost unheard of. Striking for the breadth of research and the profundity of its central insights,
                    <em>The Second Sex</em> remains to this day one of the foundational texts in philosophy, feminism, and women's studies.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Literature </h2>
                <h3 class="text-muted">a. Novels</h3>
                <p class="lead text-justify">In her autobiographies, Beauvoir often makes the claim that although her passion for philosophy was lifelong,
                    her heart was always set on becoming an author of great literature. What she succeeded in doing was writing some of the best
                    existentialist literature of the 20th century. Much as Camus and Sartre discovered, existentialism's concern for the individual
                    thrown into an absurd world and forced to act, lends itself well to the artistic medium of fiction.
                    All of Beauvoir's novels incorporate existential themes, problems, and questions in her attempt to describe
                    the human situation in times of personal turmoil, political upheaval, and social unrest.</p>
                <h3 class="text-muted">b. Short Stories</h3>
                <p class="lead text-justify">Beauvoir wrote two collections of short stories.
                    The first, <em>Quand Prime le Spirituel (When Things of the Spirit Come First)</em>
                    wasn't published until 1979 even though it was her first work of fiction submitted (and rejected) for publication (in 1937).
                    Beauvoir's second collection of short stories, <em> La Femme Rompue (The Woman Destroyed)</em>,
                    was published in 1967 and was considerably well-received. This too offers separate studies of three women,
                    each of whom is living in bad faith in one form or another. As each encounters a crisis in her familial relationships,
                    she engages in a flight from her responsibility and freedom.</p>
                <h3 class="text-muted">c. Theater</h3>
                <p class="lead text-justify">Beauvoir only wrote one play, <em>Les Bouches Inutiles (Who Shall Die?)</em>
                    which was performed in 1945-the same year of the founding of Les Temps Modernes.
                    Clearly enmeshed in the issues of World War II Europe,
                    the dilemma of this play focuses on who is worth sacrificing for the benefit of the collective.
                    This piece was influenced by the history of 14th century Italian towns that, when under siege and facing mass starvation,
                    threw out the old, sick, weak, women and children to fend for themselves so that there might be enough
                    for the strong men to hold out a little longer.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Cultural Studies</h2>
                <h3 class="text-muted">a. Travel Observations</h3>
                <p class="lead text-justify">Beauvoir was always passionate about traveling and embarked upon many adventures both alone and with Sartre and others.
                    Two trips had a tremendous impact upon her and were the impetus for two major books.
                    The first, <em>L'Amérique au Jour le Jour (America Day by Day)</em> was published in 1948,
                    the year after her lecture tour of the United States in 1947.
                    During this visit, she spent time with Richard and Ellen Wright, met Nelson Algren,
                    and visited numerous American cities such as New York, Chicago, Hollywood, Las Vegas, New Orleans and San Antonio.
                    The second major work to come out of Beauvoir's travels resulted from her two-month trip to China with Sartre in 1955.
                    Published in 1957, <em>La Longue Marche (The Long March)</em> is a generally positive account of the vast Communist country.
                    Although disturbed by the censorship and careful choreographing of their visit by the Communists,
                    she found China to be working towards a betterment in the life of its people.</p>
                <h3 class="text-muted">b. The Coming of Age</h3>
                <p class="lead text-justify">In 1967, Beauvoir began a monumental study of the same genre and caliber as The Second Sex.
                    <em>La Vieillesse (The Coming of Age, 1970)</em> met with instant critical success.
                    The Second Sex had been received with considerable hostility from many groups who did not want to be confronted
                    with an unpleasant critique of their sexist and oppressive attitudes towards women; The Coming of Age however,
                    was generally welcomed although it too critiques society's prejudices towards another oppressed group: the elderly.
                    This masterful work takes the fear of age as a cultural phenomenon and seeks to give voice to a silenced and
                    detested class of human beings. Lashing out against the injustices suffered by the old, Beauvoir successfully
                    complicates a problem all too oversimplified.</p>
